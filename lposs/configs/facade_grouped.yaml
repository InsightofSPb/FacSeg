  background:
    - "Plain surface with nothing special going on."
    - "Even look and color; normal joints or seams are fine."
    - "Ignore random stuff like shadows or passing objects."

  DAMAGE:
    - "Any structural deterioration like cracks, flaking, missing chunks, corrosion, or efflorescence."
    - "Ignore neat joints or intact decorations; this is about material that is broken or crumbling."

  WATER_STAIN:
    - "Streaky marks from water running down, often under ledges or pipes."
    - "Not the puffy-looking patches; those belong in DAMAGE."

  ORNAMENT_INTACT:
    - "Decorative piece is present and looks fine."
    - "Other issues nearby don’t mean this is damaged."

  REPAIRS:
    - "Patches or repainting that don’t match the rest; sometimes temporary covers."
    - "Not a full, even repaint."

  TEXT_OR_IMAGES:
    - "Added stuff like signs, numbers, graffiti, ads."
    - "Not the building’s own material pattern."
