prompt_descriptions:
  background:
    - "Plain surface with nothing special going on."
    - "Even look and color; normal joints or seams are fine."
    - "Ignore random stuff like shadows or passing objects."

  CRACK:
    - "A line where the surface split; thin or wide, any direction."
    - "Not regular seams or neat decorative lines."

  SPALLING:
    - "Outer layer has flaked off, showing what's beneath."
    - "Different from MISSING_ELEMENT: happens on the flat wall, not fancy pieces."

  DELAMINATION:
    - "Soft-edged patches that seem swollen or a different tone."
    - "Not the long streaks from running water."

  MISSING_ELEMENT:
    - "A piece of a decorative detail is gone, leaving a weird gap."
    - "Not the flat wall peeling."

  WATER_STAIN:
    - "Streaky marks from water running down, often under ledges or pipes."
    - "Not the puffy-looking patches."

  EFFLORESCENCE:
    - "White, powdery crust on the surface, common on brick or stone."
    - "Not paint or simple dust."

  CORROSION:
    - "Rusty spots or streaks around metal bits."
    - "Not just brown paint or a deliberate aged look."

  ORNAMENT_INTACT:
    - "Decorative piece is present and looks fine."
    - "Other issues nearby don’t mean this is damaged."

  REPAIRS:
    - "Patches or repainting that don’t match the rest; sometimes temporary covers."
    - "Not a full, even repaint."

  TEXT_OR_IMAGES:
    - "Added stuff like signs, numbers, graffiti, ads."
    - "Not the building’s own material pattern."
